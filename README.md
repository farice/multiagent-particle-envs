# Multi-Agent Particle Environment

A multi-agent particle world modified to work with [my CS590 Project](https://github.com/farice/rl-cryptography). Forked from OpenAI.

## Getting started:

- To install, `cd` into the root directory and type `pip install -e .`

- To interactively view moving to landmark scenario (see others in ./scenarios/):
`bin/interactive.py --scenario simple.py`

- Known dependencies: OpenAI gym, numpy

- To use the environments, look at the code for importing them in `make_env.py`.

## Code structure

- `make_env.py`: contains code for importing a multiagent environment as an OpenAI Gym-like object.

- `./multiagent/environment.py`: contains code for environment simulation (interaction physics, `_step()` function, etc.)

- `./multiagent/core.py`: contains classes for various objects (Entities, Landmarks, Agents, etc.) that are used throughout the code.

- `./multiagent/rendering.py`: used for displaying agent behaviors on the screen.

- `./multiagent/policy.py`: contains code for interactive policy based on keyboard input.

- `./multiagent/scenario.py`: contains base scenario object that is extended for all scenarios.

- `./multiagent/scenarios/`: folder where various scenarios/ environments are stored. scenario code consists of several functions:
    1) `make_world()`: creates all of the entities that inhabit the world (landmarks, agents, etc.), assigns their capabilities (whether they can communicate, or move, or both).
     called once at the beginning of each training session
    2) `reset_world()`: resets the world by assigning properties (position, color, etc.) to all entities in the world
    called before every episode (including after make_world() before the first episode)
    3) `reward()`: defines the reward function for a given agent
    4) `observation()`: defines the observation space of a given agent
    5) (optional) `benchmark_data()`: provides diagnostic data for policies trained on the environment (e.g. evaluation metrics)

### Creating new environments

You can create new scenarios by implementing the first 4 functions above (`make_world()`, `reset_world()`, `reward()`, and `observation()`).
